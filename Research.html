                    To create multiple options in form was difficult for me so have gone through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option">MDN WEB DOCS</a> to grab some ideas about it.
                    Images that I have used in my project are taken from Google.</p>
